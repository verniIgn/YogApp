## Project Description

I will create an app called YagApp that will allow users to filter YouTube videos with only Yoga copntent.

## Who has this problem?
People that go to YouTube with the sole purpose of finding good Yoga videos, and thus
avoid paying a fee or subcription for those fancy Yoga sites. 

## How will your project solve this problem?d
I will taylor YouTube's content just for Yoga videos. 

## What inputs does it need?
The user will be able to filter their search by Channel content, popular videos, ratings, name of videos, or key words that may be contained in the videos description. 

## What outputs does it produce?
A list of videos that match the search, plus text for comments area

## What web API(s) will it use?
YouTube's API.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
jQuery, JSON, Ajax, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Feature list
Yoga search could be filter by:
LOCATION
Video title
Video description
Video Length
Channel description
Popular videos
Amount of comments
Channel Playlist
Published on

Will show any videos/text list that matches the search criteria

Please provide stretch features for what else you would do in your app.

Will show a link to the original YouTube Channel
Will show thumbnails and user will be able to rate the video and leave a comment.
ALSO, I will add a location feature that will allow users to search for videos from instructors that are in a selected area, 
and show a map (if applicable) where that studio is located. To achieve that I will usea the google maps API, as well as the YouTube API. 
Also I will try to show something like a video feed in the landing page.
